                    Vectr is committed to complying with the DMCA and requires all users of the Service to comply as well. In order to protect the rights of copyright holders, Vectr implements a repeat infringer policy under which it may terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly violate the DMCA. Vectr’s repeat infringer policy is implemented seriously. A user may be a “repeat infringer” due to multiple copyright complaints against them within a certain period of time; however, Vectr reserves the right to terminate a user upon receiving any number of DMCA notifications from content owners. If a user’s account is terminated pursuant to Vectr’s repeat infringer policy, the user will be notified.
